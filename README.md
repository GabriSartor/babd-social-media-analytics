# BABD: Social Media Analaytics
This repository contains all the scripts, notebooks and results related to the group project for the Social Media Analytics Exam @ BABD - Master at Politecnico di Milano
Some code is still missing and other parts are in a draft-state but will be updated in future. The main reason this repository exist is to run some crawling scripts from a online-hosted VM, to host the world clouds and to share progresses among the team members. It is not intendend for external, quick to start, use or presentation. AKA sorry for bad documentation, missing data and not working code in master  :)
